==============================================================================
Department.schedules
==============================================================================

A tool for proposing schedules. Note: Any changes made after 2018-06-08 will have been done blindly. Until Further notice, I refactoring blindly. Let the open source flow through you.

Project status/phase: Development
Completion: 40%

Features
--------

- View courses currently offered
- Specify which courses you would like to modify, remove or add to the master schedule.
- For Executives: Approve or deny requests to change the master schedules.
- For IT Admins: Add or remove courses from course vocubularies.

Permissions / Workflow
----------------------

- Any logged in user -> View the schedules
- Department level -> Edit the schedule, send to registrar (if same as previous year), send it to the Deans / Provost
- Dean Level -> Edit schedule, send to department, send it to Provost
- Provost level -> Edit schedule, send back to department, send it to Registrar
- Registrar level -> view only(?), departments can change state

Todo list:
----------

- Add named vocabulary items to datagrid fields
- Write update / upgrade steps
- Style Datagrid fields so they look a little more pleasant
- Create validators: Class time conflicts, day of week conflicts, limit on number of new classes offered
- test faculty vocabulary, and decide if it needs to be cached or not.
- if functions need caching, create new cache keys.
- Create action (button) to write datagrid data to csv.
- Fix workflows


Recommendation:
---------------

- Add new user property for staff: ``'workloadHours'`` . If this is done, a Workload report could be implemented as a view, using data from the datagrid fields.

Documentation
-------------
